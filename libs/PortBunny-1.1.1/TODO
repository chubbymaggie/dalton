* pending_commands_queue should use the queue-'class' from queue.h
* same goes for active_scan_jobs_list and scan_jobs_hash. Also,
* queue_get_root should be removed and replaced with routines that
  allow easy iterations of queues.

* Further reduce traffic over /dev/portbunny

* Timestamps are 64bit-values which is OK. We should however try to
  reduce unnecessary 64bit-arithmetic.

* Use a "number of bits to shift" instead of a "CWND_BLOWUP_FACTOR" in
  congestion-control.

* If a trigger stops returning for a long while, it may be wise to
  revert to other triggers even if their quality is lower.


* Ports, which were already scanned in trigger-state don't have to be
  scanned in flood-state again, especially because its never a good
  idea to scan a port, which is also being used as a trigger. For that
  reason, it must be possible for a flood-state-scan-job to be
  initialized with already existing port-results.
  
* Randomize default tcp-triggers tried for closed ports.
